# Contributor Guidelines

Thanks for helping make Font Custom better. This project was born out of an overheard conversation between two devs in a NYC coffee shop — it's come a long ways thanks to the support of folks like you.

## Conventions

We try to follow the [Github ruby styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby) as much as possible. 

If you catch a typo or a particularly unsightly piece of code — please _do_ let us know. No such thing as too small of an improvement.

## Process

* Visit [issues](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom/issues) for ideas.
* Fork the repo.
* Create a topic branch. `git checkout -b my_sweet_feature`
* Add your tests. Run tests with `rake`.
* Develop your feature.
* Once all tests are passing, submit a pull request!

rbenv rehash

# Switch to using the new Ruby (global) or
#   or
